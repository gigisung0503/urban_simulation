# Breakdown of the Workflow

![Grasshopper Model for Sea Level Rise Simulation]('sea_level_rise.png')

1. **Data Importing**:
    - Import data from OSM (OpenStreetMap), which includes building footprints, streets, and other urban features. This data is used as a base for further analysis and simulations.
    - There is also a component to import SHP (shapefile) data. Elevation grid of 5m resolution shapefile is used here.

2. **Terrain Modeling**:
    - Building a terrain mesh from elevation points. Create a 3D model of the terrain, which is essential for simulating environmental effects like water flow.

3. **Simulation of Environmental Factors**:
    - Simulating sea level rise. Adjusting the Z value (height) would simulate the effect of rising water levels on the imported urban terrain.
    - Surface runoff simulation is also present, which is important for understanding how water flows across the terrain, which can be critical for flood analysis or urban planning.

4. **Geometry Adjustments and Analysis**:
    - OSM buildings are moved to the terrain, aligning them with the 3D model of the land, which is important for accurate simulation and visualization.
    - The final output involves rebuilding the terrain mesh as a surface for analysis to smooth out the data.

5. **Organization**:
    - The workflow is organized into sections with clear labels for different processes. Groups (colored backgrounds) are used to contain related components, which is a best practice for keeping complex Grasshopper definitions organized.

This Grasshopper definition is an example of how urban planners and environmental designers might use computational tools to understand and prepare for environmental changes and their impact on urban landscapes.
